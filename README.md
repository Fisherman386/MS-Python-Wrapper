# MS-Python-Wrapper
MS wrapper made with Python for dosboxMS Simple Machine (it can execute a .ms program with Python)

The dosboxMS folder contains a START_MS.bat file to start the dosbox emulator, but you can execute your .ms files faster with the python script.
To do it, follow this steps:
1. Download this project
2. Paste the code to be executed in the code.txt file (delete the example before)
3. Execute the python script (move to this folder on the terminal of your computer and type "python3 main.py")
