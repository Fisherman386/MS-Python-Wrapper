# MS-Python-Wrapper
MS wrapper made with Python for dosboxMS Simple Machine (it can execute a .ms program with Python)

The dosboxMS folder contains a START_MS.bat file to start the dosbox emulator, but you can execute your .ms files faster with the python script.
To do it, do the following steps:
1. Download this project
2. Paste your code in the code.txt file
3. Execute the python script (move to this folder on the terminal of your computer and write "python3 main.py")
